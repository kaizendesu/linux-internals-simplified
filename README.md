# Linux Internals Simplified Notes

This repository will include all my notes and thoughts on the
book _Linux Internals Simplified_. Unlike my previous repositories
where the code was explored via dry reading only, this repository
will use the following tools to greatly assist with the analysis:

1. _ftrace_
2. _strace_
3. _/proc_ filesystem
